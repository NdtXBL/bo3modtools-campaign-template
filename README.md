# Black Ops 3 Custom Campaign Map Template
A working campaign template that I have created using the rex folder. I've used the black ops 3 campaign scripts that were decompiled from another source.

To install into modtools, download the latest .zip file and open your Black Ops 3 root directory folder. Then paste the CP Mod Level folder (under rex/templates in the .zip) into Black Ops 3/rex/templates. After that, copy and paste the cp_mod_level.class into Black Ops 3/share/zone_source. Finally, copy and paste the cp folder (under share/raw/scripts) to Black Ops 3/share/raw/scripts.
