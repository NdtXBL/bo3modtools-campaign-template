# Black Ops 3 Custom Campaign Map Template
A working campaign template that I have created using the rex folder and cp_mod_level.class file. I didn't decompile the Black Ops 3 campaign scripts myself but they are required for this to work. You can find the decompiled scripts (including the other gamemodes) here: https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7-source.

To install into modtools, download the latest release source .zip file and open your Black Ops 3 root directory folder. Then paste the CP Mod Level folder (under rex/templates in the .zip) into Black Ops 3/rex/templates. After that, copy and paste the cp_mod_level.class into Black Ops 3/share/zone_source. Finally, copy and paste the cp folder (under share/raw/scripts) to Black Ops 3/share/raw/scripts if you haven't already.
